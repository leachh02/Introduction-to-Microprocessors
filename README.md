# Introduction-to-Microprocessors

## Course Outline:
First C programs: Variables, expressions, and data types. Standard input/output. Compiling, linking and running

Making Decisions and Pointers

Loops and Redirecting standard I/O (introductory stream processing)

Arrays, introducing strings.

Functions and Local and Global Variables

The binary representation of data and bitwise operations

Intro to Microcontrollers.  

Serial Communication

Timers and Interrupts

Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC) and Pulse width Modulation (PWM)

The LCD Display

## Code:
main.c - A C program for the ATmega328P microcontroller that controls a device used by explorers in harsh weather conditions (screenshot of TinerCAD Project attached).

SirenCode.c - Another C program that controls the ATmega32U4 microcontroller which with the use of PWM, produces sawtooth signal with a specific frequency that passes through a buzzer on a hardwired circuit (HEX file has also been included).
